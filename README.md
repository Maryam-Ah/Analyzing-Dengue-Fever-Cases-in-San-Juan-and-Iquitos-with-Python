# Analyzing-Dengue-Fever-Cases-in-San-Juan-and-Iquitos-with-Python
The scope of our analysis will be focused on understanding the environmental variables and determining whether there are key environmental features that lead to a higher number of Dengue fever cases. Our problem statement is: “What environmental features contribute to a higher number of Dengue Fever cases in San Juan and Iquitos
Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that commonly occurs in tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world.
Environmental data was collected by various U.S. Federal Government agencies for San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru. The main environmental data points observed are:
• Temperature
• Precipitation
• Humidity
• Vegetation
This dataset is currently being used in a competition hosted by DrivenData with the following problem statement: “Can you predict local epidemics of Dengue fever?”
The scope of our analysis will be focused on understanding the environmental variables and determining whether there are key environmental features that lead to a higher number of Dengue fever cases. Our problem statement is: “What environmental features contribute to a higher number of Dengue Fever cases in San Juan and Iquitos?
The analysis explores:
1. Whether there are key environmental factors overall that contribute to the high number of Dengue Fever cases and;
2. Whether there are key environmental differences between San Juan and Iquitos.
II. Data Preparation
a. Data Source
The data was from open data on the DrivenData Competition website:
https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/page/82/
To access the datasets, a user account needed to be set-up and the user needed to join the competition. Once this was set-up, there were 2 datasets that need to be downloaded:
• “dengue_features_train.csv”
• “dengue_labels_train.csv”
